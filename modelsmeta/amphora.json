Because it can be placed in a variety of poses and also thrown it is going to be seen from different angles. Therefore I couldn't cut out any back-facing polygons, and it had to look okay from all sides. It's brightly coloured to contrast with the background. The arms of the amphora use up quite a lot of polygons (bendy things are a pain to model cheaply), but the torch illumination looks nice on the different faces as the hero moves around. ",
