They can also be knocked over by a boulder. This causes the whole screen to shake and debris to fall down all around the place. The pillar falls into a 2-tile gap and stops, forming an artificial bridge. The model breaks into segments during the animation - this meant that I had to model the tops and bottoms of each pillar segment, which more or less doubled the number of triangles used in the model.
