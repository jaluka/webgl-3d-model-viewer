	"mDescription" : "I couldn't quite decide if doors in the game should ever be opened the conventional way, or if the barbarian would break them all off their hinges. A big wooden door opened slowly would be an excuse for a nice creaky sound effect however. The action in Crongdor is largery based around rooms, so the doors symbolise a transition to the next scene. I went for a gothic looking door somewhat inspired by the HeroQuest board game. There's not a lot of detail in the geometry so the masonry is drawn on rather than sculpted. Because of the overhead view of the game you never really get a clear view of the door face which is a shame but perhaps a door-breaking animation could change this! I didn't bother making any wall above the door frame so that it's easier to see the door in the game. This seems to work quite well. The game's MiP-mapping made the door look a little blurry because of the angle to the camera, so I tweaked the game engine to use beter an-isotropic filtering for the doors.",
